Hi! Welcome to Bairui (Barry) Zhang's homepage. I am a senior in Computer Science at **Northeastern University**, where I GPA rank in the **top 2.6%** of my major with a GPA of **3.99/4.0**. Currently, I serve as a Research Assistant at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen**, affiliated with the [CUHKSZ NLP Group](https://freedomintelligence.github.io/) under the supervision of [Prof. Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old.html). Previously, I participated in a Research Camp led by **MIT** Professor [Manolis Kellis](https://web.mit.edu/manoli/), where I earned an **A** (98) and ranked **1st** in my team.

My research interests include Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), AI Agent, AI for Healthcare, Embodied Intelligence, AGI, and Human-Computer Interaction. I am actively seeking **MPhil/Ph.D.** opportunities in 2025 Fall.

Contact me through: Barryzbr12[AT]gmail.com or Barryzhang[AT]stumail.neu.edu.cn. Find my [CV](./assets/CV_Bairui_Zhang.pdf) Here.

[Large Language Models for Outpatient Referral: Problem Definition, Benchmarking and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08292)

Xiaoxiao Liu, Qingying Xiao, Junying Chen, Xiangyi Feng, Xiangbo Wu, **Bairui Zhang**, Xiang Wan, Jian Chang, Guangjun Yu, Yan Hu, Benyou Wang.

- This study investigates the application of large language models (LLMs) in outpatient referral tasks, proposing a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes static classification and dynamic dialogue tasks. The authors introduce the IOR-Bench dataset and find that while LLMs show limited advantages over traditional models in static tasks, they demonstrate potential in dynamic interactions by asking effective questions. The work highlights the need for further improvements in LLMs' ability to integrate diverse medical information and refine recommendations through iterative dialogues.

[Augmenting Categorical Emotion Detection with Visual Emotion Priors](./assets/NAACL.pdf)

Changrong Min, **Bairui Zhang**, Hongfei Lin, Ximing Li


- This task aims to identify emotions in text. While Prompt Tuning (PT) has been used, current detectors struggle with designing efficient prompts. We propose VISPOR (Visual Emotion Prefix-guided Emotion Detector), which leverages visual information to enhance emotion detection. By aligning emotional text descriptions with images and using visually enriched embeddings as prefixes, VISPOR captures more nuanced emotion features. Experiments show VISPOR outperforms existing methods on three benchmarks.

[Artificial Intelligence in Pancreatic Image Analysis: A Review](https://doi.org/10.3390/s24144749)

Weixuan Liu, **Bairui Zhang**, Tao Liu, Juntao Jiang, Yong Liu

- This work explores the application of AI in pancreatic cancer diagnosis, focusing on segmentation, classification, object detection, and prognosis prediction using CT, MRI, EUS, PET, and pathological images. It aims to improve diagnostic and treatment accuracy by integrating various imaging techniques, and discusses current trends and future developments in AI-driven pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

[Factors that increase the mortality of sepsis and personalized medication for patients with sepsis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3644116.3644330)

**Bairui Zhang**, Qianlong Cai, Junyang Ding, Kaitao Yuan

- This work develops a machine learning model to predict mortality and recommend medications for sepsis patients. Extreme Gradient Boosting achieved the best accuracy for both mortality (0.802) and drug prediction (0.867). Key factors affecting mortality include age and respiratory rate. Heparin, Acetaminophen, and Metoprolol Tartrate were effective, while Hydromorphone was linked to higher mortality.
